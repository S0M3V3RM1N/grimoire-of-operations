# grimoire-of-operations

*A living record of tactics, frameworks, and research across the disciplines of cybersecurity.*

The point of this repo is to serve as a point of reference for aspiring analysts or those already operating in the field. It is ever expanding as I personally dive deeper into the world of cybersecurity and blue team operations. If you need a quick reference or looking to break into the field of cybersecurity (specifically blue team oriented roles) then this repo can help.
