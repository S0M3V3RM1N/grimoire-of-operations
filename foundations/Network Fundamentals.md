# Networking Fundamentals

This page is a brief breakdown of the networking knowledge needed to find success in a career in cybersecurity, administration, and network infrastructure. This is not a copy & paste from the resources found online. Instead this can be used as a quick reference or review for what you may already know. Networking is an entire beast in itself, a mountain that doesn't stop growing much like security. These topics are high-level and won't serve as pasted net+ guide or help you get your CCNA. However, the idea behind this "guide" is to help one start to understand how networks transmit data. It should help your brain form the questions you need to ask and research on your own to feel confident in understanding how networking and security run hand-and-hand.
