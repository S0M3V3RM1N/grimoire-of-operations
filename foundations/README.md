# Foundations

The Foundations directory is where core knowledge is forged and refined. Here lies the base layer beneath every successful operation. This is where we document the fundamentals behind blue team operatiosn and cybersecurity. The point isnt to memorize. Forming a deep understanding and carving a pathway to building, breaking, and defending with intention is the goal.

## Topics Covered

- **Networking Essentials**
- **Operating Systems** 
- **Security Concepts**
- **Command-Line Mastery**

## Why This Exists

Before frameworks, before playbooks - there must be understanding. The contents here aren't meant to be exhaustive; rather they can serve as tactical primers and quick refreshers. A cheat sheet of the bedrock to the entire field of security. Despite the many videos and articles talking about entry level cybersecurity jobs, the truth is that this field is far from anything entry. You need a strong foundation of how systems work and networks talk if you want to protect them (or break them (ethically)).
