# ðŸ§± Foundations

The Foundations directory is where core knowledge is forged and refined. Here lies the base layer beneath every successful operation. This is where we document the fundamentals, not as a textbook, but as a tactical reference. The point isnt to memorize, it's to form a deep understanding and carve the pathway to building, breaking, and defending with intention.

## Topics Covered

- **Networking Essentials** - Subnetting, VLANs, routing logic, switch behavior, and packet flow.
- **Operating Systems** - Linux, MacOS, Windows internals, system processes, and shell environments.
- **Security Concepts** - Authentication, encryptions, attack surfaces, privilege boundaries, and basic hardening measures.
- **Command-Line Mastery** - Shell usage, file operations, permissions, and basic scripting.

## Why This Exists

Before frameworks, before playbooks - there must be understanding. The contents here aren't meant to be exhaustive; rather they can serve as tactical primers. A cheat sheet of the bedrock to the entire field of security. Despite the many videos and articles talking about entry level cybersecurity jobs, the truth is that this field is far from anything entry. You need a strong foundation of how systems work if you want to protect them (or break them (ethically)).
