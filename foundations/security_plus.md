# Security+ Foundations

The CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification serves as a baseline for anyone beginning a career in cybersecurity. It validates core knowledge required in any security role and is often the first stepping stone for blue team professionals. This foundation file outlines the key domains and concepts covered in the certification and serves as a launchpad for deeper practical learning.

## 🧠 Security+ Domains Overview

### 1. **General Security Concepts**
- CIA Triad: **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**
- Threat actors & attack vectors
- Vulnerability types (zero-day, misconfigurations, race conditions)
- Security control types: **Administrative, Technical, Physical**
- Security control categories: **Preventive, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Compensating**

---

### 2. **Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations**
- Social engineering (phishing, smishing, vishing, tailgating, impersonation)
- Malware types (ransomware, trojans, rootkits, spyware, worms, fileless malware)
- Threat intelligence sources (OSINT, STIX/TAXII, threat feeds)
- Vulnerability scanning vs. penetration testing
- Common weaknesses (unpatched systems, default credentials, open ports)

---

### 3. **Security Architecture**
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Secure system design (least privilege, defense in depth)
- Secure baselining and configuration management
- Hardware-based security (HSMs, TPMs)

---

### 4. **Security Operations**
- Incident response process: **Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned**
- SIEM, SOAR, EDR/XDR tools
- Log analysis and correlation
- Identity and access management (IAM), RBAC vs ABAC
- Security awareness training

---

### 5. **Security Program Management and Oversight**
- Risk management fundamentals: **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**
- Governance, policies, and frameworks (NIST, ISO, COBIT, CIS)
- Business continuity vs disaster recovery
- SLA, MOU, BPA, NDA
- Compliance and regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, FISMA)

---

## Key Security Principles to Remember

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and systems should have only the access necessary to perform their job.
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered security controls reduce the risk of breach.
- **Security through Obscurity is not Security**: Don’t rely on secrecy alone.
- **Patch Early, Patch Often**: Unpatched systems are low-hanging fruit for attackers.
- **Humans are the weakest link**: Prioritize security awareness.

---

## Useful Tools & Terms
- **Nmap**: Network scanner for discovery and auditing
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer
- **Hashcat / John the Ripper**: Password cracking tools
- **OpenVAS / Nessus**: Vulnerability scanners
- **Shodan**: Search engine for internet-connected devices

---

## Next Steps
- Supplement with HTB Academy’s Security+ prep labs
- Pair each domain with a real-world tool or tactic
- Dive deeper into NIST SP 800-61, 800-53 for operational maturity
