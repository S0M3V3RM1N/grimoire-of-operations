# 🖼️ Frameworks

This directory contains distilled notes and interpretations of the major frameworks and methodologies used across the cybersecurity domain. This isn't just pasted whitepapers. The aim is a field ready guide meant to help form an understanding of how these frameworks can be applied to decision-making under pressure and guide action to maintaining a compliant and secure environment.

## What's Included

- **ATT&CK** - Adversary Tactics, techniquies, and common knowledge, broken down with practical examples.
- **NIST** - Core functions, incident response lifecycle, risk frameworks, and real-world mappings.
- **CIS Controls** - A prioritized set of actions to improve defense posture, tailored by environment.
- **Kill Chain** – Structured understanding of adversary progression and where to break it.
- **Diamond Model** – Threat intelligence correlation framework to understand adversary infrastructure and behavior.
- **Cyber Kill Chain vs ATT&CK vs D3FEND** – Comparative breakdowns where useful.

## Purpose 

Frameworks provide language and structure. This directory isn't about memorization — it’s about **turning theory into an action plan**. When threat actors don’t play by the book, we still need one in hand to track, predict, and respond. These notes help us adapt the models to the moment.
