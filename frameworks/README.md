# Frameworks

This directory contains notes and interpretations of the major frameworks and methodologies used across the cybersecurity domain. The aim is a field ready guide meant to help form an understanding of how these frameworks can be applied to decision-making under pressure and guide action to maintaining a compliant and secure environment. This can serve as a quick reference to someone already working in the field or as a helpful resource to someone trying to break into a dedicated security role and learn more about the realm of cybersecurity. 

## What's Included

- **ATT&CK** - Adversary Tactics, techniquies, and common knowledge, broken down with practical examples.
- **NIST** - Core functions, incident response lifecycle, risk frameworks, and real-world mappings.
- **Kill Chain** – Structured understanding of adversary progression and where to break it.

## Purpose 

Frameworks provide language and structure. When threat actors don’t play by the book, we still need one in hand to track, predict, and respond. These notes help us adapt the models to the moment.
