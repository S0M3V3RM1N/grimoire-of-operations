# The Compendium of Frameworks

---

Welcome to the Compendium — a living archive of cybersecurity frameworks that shape operational thinking and defense strategy.  
Each framework listed here is broken down into key components, real-world applications, and critical evaluations.

This is not just a mirror of public knowledge.  
This is an operational translation: how frameworks actually live, breathe, and break in the field.
