# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 - Operational Guide

This guide summarizes the structure and utility of the NIST CSF 2.0 and is intended for use in your Grimoire of Operations. The content is designed to assist with practical implementation and communication of cybersecurity risk management strategies.

## 1. Framework Structure

### Core Components

* **Functions (6 total)**

  * **GOVERN**: Define, oversee, and integrate risk management strategy and expectations.
  * **IDENTIFY**: Understand assets, risks, and organizational context.
  * **PROTECT**: Implement safeguards to mitigate risk.
  * **DETECT**: Identify cybersecurity incidents.
  * **RESPOND**: React to incidents with mitigation and communication.
  * **RECOVER**: Restore capabilities and operations post-incident.

* **Categories & Subcategories**

  * Nested under each Function.
  * Represent outcomes, not actions.
  * Technology- and sector-neutral.

## 2. Organizational Profiles

### Purpose

Profiles represent an organization’s:

* **Current state** of cybersecurity ("Current Profile")
* **Desired state** or risk tolerance ("Target Profile")

### Use Cases

* Tailor security goals
* Communicate cybersecurity posture
* Prioritize remediation

### Profile Creation Process

1. **Scope the Profile**: Define what segment of the organization it covers.
2. **Gather Input**: Pull from policies, BIAs, existing controls.
3. **Document Outcomes**: Align to CSF Core.
4. **Gap Analysis**: Compare Current vs Target.
5. **Implement Plan**: Address deficiencies, track progress.

Community Profiles (sector or threat-based baselines) can inform Targets.

## 3. CSF Tiers

### Description

Tiers reflect the maturity of cybersecurity governance and risk management practices.

| Tier             | Governance                                  | Risk Management                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Partial       | Ad hoc, limited awareness                   | Irregular, isolated practices              |
| 2. Risk Informed | Some consistency, loosely linked to mission | Basic awareness, informal sharing          |
| 3. Repeatable    | Formal policy, consistent practices         | Regular updates, integrated communications |
| 4. Adaptive      | Fully integrated with ERM, data-driven      | Predictive, real-time awareness            |

Use Tiers to contextualize risk posture across Profiles.

* **Informative References**: Mappings to other frameworks (e.g., SP 800-53).
* **Implementation Examples**: Suggested action steps ("develop", "monitor", etc.).
* **Quick Start Guides (QSGs)**: Practical entry points tailored to sectors or roles.
* **Community Profiles & Templates**: Predefined baselines and formats.

## 5. Integrating CSF with Risk Programs

### Risk Communication

* Shared vocabulary between executives, managers, and practitioners.
* Organizational Profiles support strategic, tactical, and operational alignment.

### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Integration

* CSF enables translation of cyber risks to business language.
* Supported by IR 8286 series and SP 800-221.

### Risk Types Covered

* **Cybersecurity risk management** (SP 800-37, 800-30, 800-53)
* **Privacy risk** (NIST Privacy Framework, PRAM)
* **Supply chain risk** (SP 800-161r1)
* **AI and emerging tech risk** (NIST AI RMF)

## 6. Application Tips

* Customize Profile scope to avoid overgeneralization.
* Profiles aren't audits; they describe *what*, not *how*.
* Use CSF alongside existing tools (SIEM, IR playbooks, etc.).
* Iterate periodically—it's a cycle, not a checklist.
* Link outcomes to specific controls (via Informative References).
