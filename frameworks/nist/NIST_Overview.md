# NIST Overview – Cybersecurity and Blue Team Relevance

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** is a U.S. federal agency under the Department of Commerce. While it is non-regulatory, its frameworks and publications are considered **gold standards** for managing risk, protecting systems, and responding to cyber threats.

NIST develops cybersecurity standards and guidance to improve the security and resilience of information systems across both public and private sectors.

## Why NIST Matters in Cybersecurity

NIST publications are **vendor-agnostic**, **well-researched**, and frequently updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape. They are widely used to:

* Build security programs
* Shape compliance strategies (e.g., FedRAMP, FISMA, CMMC)
* Develop and assess incident response procedures
* Align internal processes with national standards

For blue teams, NIST provides established guidance on:

* Threat detection
* Incident response
* Risk management
* Security controls and baselines
* Cybersecurity assessments and penetration testing

## Core NIST Cybersecurity Frameworks

These are the most relevant NIST documents for defenders:

| Publication                           | Focus                                     | Use Case                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (April 2025)**     | Incident Response                         | Building IR plans and risk-based response workflows                     |
| **SP 800-53 Rev. 5**                  | Security & Privacy Controls               | Hardening systems and defining baselines                                |
| **SP 800-115**                        | Security Testing & Assessment             | Penetration testing and blue/red team assessment operations             |
| **Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)** | Risk-Based Security                       | Strategic framework for Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover |
| **SP 800-171**                        | Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) | Required for organizations handling federal CUI                         |
| **SP 800-137**                        | Continuous Monitoring                     | Ongoing assessment and automated defensive response                     |

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

NIST guidance is often interoperable with other cybersecurity frameworks such as:

* **MITRE ATT&CK** – Used to map adversary tactics and detection capabilities
* **CIS Controls** – Implementation-focused, often mapped directly to NIST CSF categories
* **Cyber Kill Chain** – Complements NIST’s structured incident response and defense lifecycle modeling
