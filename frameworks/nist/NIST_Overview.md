# NIST Overview ‚Äì Cybersecurity and Blue Team Relevance

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** is a U.S. federal agency under the Department of Commerce. While it's non-regulatory, its frameworks and publications are considered **gold standards** for managing risk, protecting systems, and responding to cyber threats.

NIST plays a foundational role in cybersecurity policy, standards, and guidance ‚Äî particularly for government agencies and critical infrastructure, but its influence extends to the private sector as well.

## üîê Why NIST Matters in Cybersecurity

NIST publications are **vendor-agnostic**, **well-researched**, and frequently updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape. They are widely used to:

- Build security programs
- Shape compliance strategies (e.g., FedRAMP, FISMA, CMMC)
- Develop and assess incident response procedures
- Align internal processes with national standards

For blue teams, NIST provides battle-tested guidance on:
- Threat detection
- Incident response
- Risk management
- Security controls and baselines
- Cybersecurity assessments and penetration testing

## üß≠ Core NIST Cybersecurity Frameworks

These are the most relevant NIST documents for cyber defenders:

| Publication | Focus | Use Case |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **SP 800-61 Rev. 2** | Incident Response | Building IR plans and response workflows |
| **SP 800-53 Rev. 5** | Security & Privacy Controls | Hardening systems and defining baselines |
| **SP 800-115** | Security Testing & Assessment | Pen testing, security assessments, red/blue team ops |
| **Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** | Risk-Based Security | High-level strategy for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering |
| **SP 800-171** | Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) | Required for government contractors and those handling CUI |
| **SP 800-137** | Continuous Monitoring | Ongoing assessment and automated response |

## üîÑ Relationship to Other Frameworks

NIST guidance is often **interoperable** with other frameworks like:

- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Tactics/techniques used for detection mapping
- **CIS Controls**: More prescriptive and implementation-focused, often mapped to NIST CSF
- **Kill Chain**: Complements NIST‚Äôs structured IR process with attacker lifecycle modeling
