# NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 â€“ Security and Privacy Controls

NIST SP 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of **security and privacy controls** that federal agencies â€” and increasingly private organizations â€” use to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.

This publication supports the development of secure systems by guiding:

* Risk management
* System hardening
* Control baselining
* Compliance with federal mandates like FISMA and FedRAMP

It is widely considered a blueprint for building, implementing, and auditing secure IT environments.

## ðŸ“š Structure of the Controls Catalog

SP 800-53 is broken into **20 control families**. Each family focuses on a critical domain of security and privacy. Here are a few examples:

| Control Family                            | Description                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **AC** â€“ Access Control                   | Who can access what, and under what conditions   |
| **AU** â€“ Audit and Accountability         | Logging and audit trails                         |
| **CM** â€“ Configuration Management         | System integrity and baseline management         |
| **IR** â€“ Incident Response                | Detection, reporting, and containment procedures |
| **SI** â€“ System and Information Integrity | Malware defenses, alerts, and patching           |
| **RA** â€“ Risk Assessment                  | Periodic threat and vulnerability assessments    |

Each control typically includes:

* **Control statement** (what must be done)
* **Control enhancements** (additional rigor or complexity)
* **Assessment procedures** (how to evaluate effectiveness)

## ðŸ”„ Baseline Implementation Tiers

Controls are applied based on impact level:

* **Low** â€“ Minor effect on operations
* **Moderate** â€“ Significant but manageable impact
* **High** â€“ Severe or catastrophic consequences if compromised

Organizations select baseline controls and then tailor them to their environment.

## ðŸ§° Use Cases for Blue Teamers

* **Hardening checklists**: Use SP 800-53 controls to build secure baselines for systems and applications
* **Gap analysis**: Evaluate current security posture against control expectations
* **Audit prep**: Align logs, policies, and procedures to controls that are most scrutinized
* **Policy writing**: Draft security policies with language mapped to control families
