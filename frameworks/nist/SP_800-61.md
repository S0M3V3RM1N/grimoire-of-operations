# NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3 – Incident Response Recommendation and Considerations
**NIST Published:** April, 2025
**DOI:** <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-61r3>

## What it Covers:
This document provides guidance for how organizations should plan for, detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Incident response is an integral component of cybersecurity risk management, not just a reactive technical process. Further, this document helps to highlight the information found in the official NIST documentation. Feel free to use this resource as a quick reference or to help strengthen your organizations security posture.

## Executive Summary:
Incident response, as mentioned above, is an integral part of risk management in the realm of cybersecurity. All six CSF 2.0 functions play vital roles; Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

- **Govern, Identify, Protect:** Prevent incidents, prepare response, reduce impact, and improve practices.

- **Detect, Respond, Recover:** Discover, prioritize, contain, eradicate, recover, and report incidents.

Organizations cannot control adversary tactics or timing, but they can apply lifecycle models to strengthen resilience and reduce risk.

### Purpose and Scope

The document provides a common language for organizations to integrate incident response into all phases of risk management. It supersedes SP 800-61r2 (2012) and focuses on improving risk management across all CSF 2.0 Functions, not static operational guidance.

Organizations are directed to use:

- The CSF 2.0 publication and resources

- The NIST Incident Response project page

- The Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT) for mapping controls (e.g., CSF outcomes to SP 800-53 controls)

### Incident Response as Part of Cybersecurity Risk Management

#### Life Cycle Model

The previous SP 800-61r2 model assumed discrete, infrequent incidents. Today's landscape has changed. Incidents are a continuous and complex. 

New CSF 2.0-aligned lifecycle model:

- Govern (GV): Establish strategy, expectations, policy.
- Identify (ID): Understand risks.
- Protect (PR): Implement safeguards.
- Detect (DE): Find and analyze attacks.
- Respond (RS): Take action.
- Recover (RC): Restore operations.

Lessons learned feed into continuous improvement (ID.IM) across all functions.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

Incident response now spans across organizational boundaries:

- Leadership: Oversight, funding, high-impact decisions.
- Incident Handlers - Verification, triage, containment, analysis.
- Technology Professionals - Network, cloud, and system engineers.
- Legal & HR - Compliance, policy, privacy, and insider threats.
- Public Affairs - Media engagement and communication strategy.
- Third Parties - MSSPs, CSPs, ISPs in shared-responsibility models.

#### Policies, Processes, Procedures

Organizations should define:

- Management commitment, scope, definitions
- Roles, authorities, performance measures
- Prioritization, recovery initiation, documentation

Playbooks (e.g., CISA Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks) are recommended for actionable procedures and training that apply to all relevant parties involved in IR. When push comes to shove, no one should be left scrambling on what to do next. Plan, define, practice so that IR is not a reactive measure but a well crafted procedure ready to take on the challenges associated with a cybersecurity incident.

### CSF 2.0 Community Profile for Cyber Incident Risk Management

The community profile identifies prioritized CSF outcomes for managing incident risk. 

#### Prioritization Levels

- High: Core incident response activities
- Medium: Directly support IR
- Low: Indirect support

Each entry includes recommendations (R), considerations (C), or notes (N) linked to CSF functions, categories, and subcategories. 

#### Preparation and Lessons Learned

Covers Govern, Identify, Protect, and Identify-Improvement (ID.IM) functions. 

Examples: 

- GV.OC-03 (Legal Requirements): Include incident notification and breach reporting.
- GV.RR-02 (Roles/Authorities): Document and empower all IR roles, internal and external.
- ID.AM-01/-02: Maintain current, automated asset and software inventories for detection and analysis.
- ID.RA-05 (Risk Understanding): User threat modeling to inform attack and surface analysis.
- ID.IM-04 (Plans): Synchronize incident response and business continuity plans.

#### Incident Response

Covers Detect, Respond, Recover functions.

Highlights: 

- DE.CM (Continuous Monitoring: Monitor all asset types and services providers.
- DE.AE (Adverse Event Analysis): Use SIEM/SOAR for filtering, correlation, and incident declaration.
- RS.MA (Incident Management): Triage, categorize, escalate, and coordinate recovery initiation.
- RS.AN (Analysis): Establish what occurred, gather evidence, preserve integrity.
- RS.CO (Communication): Coordinate notification, sharing, and law‑enforcement engagement.
- RS.MI (Mitigation): Contain and eradicate; may involve automated or manual actions.
- RC.RP (Recovery Execution): Verify backup integrity, restore assets, confirm remediation.
- RC.CO (Recovery Communication): Report recovery progress and share public updates.
