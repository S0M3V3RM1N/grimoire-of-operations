# NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 â€“ The IR Blueprint

**800-61 Rev. 2** is *the* gold standard for setting up an Incident Response program. It defines the incident response lifecycle, broken down into four phases:

## 1. Preparation
 - Establish and train an IR team
 - Build playbooks and test them
 - Harden Systems and establish logging/monitoring
 - Define communication channels and escalation paths

## 2. Detection and Analysis 
 - Monitor for anomalies via logs, SIEMs, EDRs, IDS/IPS
 - Validate that an incident occurred
 - Categorize the incident (e.g., DoS, insider threat, malware)

***Important Concepts*** 
 - Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
 - Use triage logics to confirm incident scope and severity (see triage_tips.md)
 - Document and timestamp **everything**

## 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery  
 - Stop the bleeding (containment)
 - Remove root cause (eradication)
 - Restory systems and validate operational status (recovery)

***Best Practices***
 - Short-term vs long-term containment
 - Reimage or rebuild systems when needed
 - Patch and monitor restored systems carefully

## 4. Post-Incident Activity
 - Conduct lessons-learned meetings (within the first 2 weeks)
 - Update IR documentation and controls (or create them if an organization never had anything in place)
 - Feed findings into future risk assessments

***Artifacts to Create:***
 - Incident Summary Reports
 - Root cause analysis (RCA)
 - Metrics: time-to-detect, time-to-contain, etc.
