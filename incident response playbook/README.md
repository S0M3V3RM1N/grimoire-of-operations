# üõ°Ô∏è Incident Response Handbook

This is my personal incident response playbook, built from direct, hands-on experience in a hybrid networking and security role within an educational environment. The goal is to provide practical, repeatable procedures for common security incidents, and to document my growth as I deepen my skills in blue team operations.

## Purpose

This repository serves to:
- Document real-world response processes I‚Äôve used or developed.
- Provide structure for continued learning in incident detection, triage, and remediation.
- Offer transparency into how I approach security as an evolving practitioner.

## Scope

Currently includes response procedures for:
- **Phishing Emails** ‚Äì Triage, investigation, and user remediation in a Google Workspace environment.
- **Account Compromise** ‚Äì Detecting and responding to suspected credential theft.
- **Vulnerability Triage** ‚Äì Prioritizing remediation based on third-party scan data.
- **Initial Access Detection** ‚Äì (WIP) Monitoring and anomaly detection practices using NDR and log data.
- **Tools Used** ‚Äì Summaries and notes on utility usage.
- **Templates** ‚Äì Communication samples and log documentation formats.

## Approach

I believe in continuous improvement and self-education. This repo reflects that philosophy ‚Äî learning by doing, documenting what works, and refining process over time. It's meant to grow as my access to new tools and responsibilities expands.

## üîÑ Work in Progress

As I explore deeper topics like SIEM correlation, firewall log analysis, and scripting for automation, more content will be added.

These documents are based on personal experience and should be adapted for your own environment. They are not official guidance or policy, and should be reviewed before production use.
