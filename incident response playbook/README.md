# Incident Response Handbook

This directory contains a growing collection of practical playbooks and references for incident detection, triage, and remediation. Each file reflects real-world experience gained through network and security operations in an educational enterprise environment.

## Purpose

* Establish structured and repeatable processes for responding to common security incidents.
* Provide a personal reference for blue team workflows, log analysis, and operational improvement.
* Serve as a living record of lessons learned, tools explored, and methods refined over time.

## Methodology

The approach emphasizes clarity and adaptability:

* Document actions taken during real incidents.
* Translate lessons learned into structured, reusable playbooks.
* Continuously refine based on tooling changes, visibility improvements, and evolving threats.

## Future Expansion

Upcoming playbooks will focus on:

* EDR alert triage and host isolation.
* Firewall event correlation and rule verification.
* Threat hunting methodologies using baselines and IOC data.
* Automation workflows for alert enrichment and reporting.
