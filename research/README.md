# ðŸ§  Research

This directory serves as a staging ground for ongoing research as I dive deeper into security, computer science, and rabbit holes where the two topics merge. 

Expect rough notes, partial analyses, and the occasional polished write-up as I form my voice. Topics can span from protocol behavior and tool usage to broader concepts in threat intelligence, privacy, and adversary tradecraft. 

I plan to add sub-directories as my knowledge expands. 

Use at your own risk. I am no doctor. Things can be wrong or uncomplete. I welcome criticism and shared expansion.
